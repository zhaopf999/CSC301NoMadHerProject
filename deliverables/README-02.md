## Description 

	NomadHer is a mobile app that connects solo female travelers and help them travel safely. The value of the app is that we hope we can use this app to encourage women around the world to travel solo, as there are many out there who wish to do but cannot out of security issues. The problem we are trying to solve is the safety issue that the solo female travelers are facing, for example, the difficulty of finding a secure female host. We want to ensure that all users of our app are real, good female users that can be trusted by other female users. To ensure this, we verify each user before they can access other functionalities of our app. We verify each user by asking her to upload her selfies and photo identification, so we can know whether this person is trustable.


## Key Features
	For this part of the project, we implement the login part and verification part. The login part uses the Facebook login which requires the user to input his Facebook account and password. After the login, the user is supposed to do the image verification. 
		1. If the user has already finished the verification, then he will be directed to a welcome page. 
		2. If the user has taken the verification photo but is still under review, then the user will be directed to a pending page.
		3. If the user has not done the verification, then the user will be directed to the verification page.

	For the verification part, 
		1. The user will press the “verification” button.
		2. There will an image show up in a new page. The user will look at the posture in the image and press “take photo” button. 
		3. A new page shows up with a countdown number showing on the top and a camera on the bottom. The user needs to make the same posture as in last page. A photo will be automatically taken when the countdown reaches zero. 
		4. Then the photo taken by the user will show up in a new page and a “next” button on the bottom. 
		5. When the user press “next” button, she will be directed to the pending page which mean her verification is submitted and will be evaluated manually.
