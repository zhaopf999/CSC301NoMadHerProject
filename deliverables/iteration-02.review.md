# Team 5- NomadHer

## Iteration 02 - Review & Retrospect
 * When: 1:00 PM, March 9, 2019
 * Where: BA2240 


## Process - Reflection


#### Decisions that turned out well
1. We divided our seven team members into a three-person front-end team and a four-person back-end team.
This distribution makes our work assignments clearer, and everyone finds the task he or she should do. And when a team member meets a problem, there are enough other members of the same team to help him.

2. Create two sperate folders for backend and frontend. 
Two teams work on their own folder which improves on reducing conflict and confusion.

3. At first we created two branches for front-end and back-end, merging them after both sub-teams finish their development, then we try to combine them into a fully integrated project. This turns out to be very successful


#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped
1. We originally want to use face recognition system to auto-verify user identity: We agreed that it is very hard to implement thus switched to manual verification.

2. At first we planned to everyone coding their assigned parts & files on master branch, it turned out that this results in enormous amount of conflicts, so we divided team into frontend and backend.


#### Planned changes
1. Adjust our team allocation and assign more people to the front-end team.
In this stage, we need to learn about Firebase and design a suitable data schema, so we assign more people to the back-end team. In the follow-up work, the front-end work may need more members, so we made this change.

2. Start next iteration early.
In this iteration, we were facing a tight timeline, the next deliverable may require a more integrated product, this means we need more efficient planning and faster development speed. 


## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

1. Achieve basic user authentication - including uploading a photo ID and taking photos as required by random images guide.
2. Implemented the login function using facebook.
3. Successfully associated the app with Google's Firebase database to store user information.

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

1. Have not implemented video verification. (Temporarily used photo verification, and we will try to upgrade to use video in future developments)

2. Have not implemented the part where Master account users can manually compare and verify users' identities.


## Meeting Highlights

1. More frequent team meeting.
2. faster development cycle
3. More meeting with Nomadher team.
