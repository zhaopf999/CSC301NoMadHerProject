# Team 5- NomadHer

## Iteration 03 - Review & Retrospect
 * When: 1:00PM, Friday, March 29
 * Where: BA2240 


## Process - Reflection


#### Decisions that turned out well

In D2, we divided our seven-person team into a three-person front-end team and a four-person back-end team.

Now in D3, We need a separate Web application for the administrators to manually verify users. So the previous four-person back-end team from D2 turns into development of the Web application, while the three-person front-end team continues to polish and adding new features to the mobile app prototype, completing missing components.

The Web application team is working on another new branch named “nomadher-admin”, the two teams work on their own folder which improves on reducing conflict and confusion. After each team was done, the branches were merged into master branch.

As D3 became the last product to be delivered in this semester, (for this course as well), the workload for completing D3 increased in scale. The product we made from D2 was not yet completed, but meanwhile we need another completely new Web application designed for the administrators. 

Since this time we are building a brand new Web application on a brand new branch, every team member is working on different files, there was no need to concern about overlapping. 

Performing team splitting again makes our work assignments clearer, and everyone finds the task he or she should do. When a team member meets a problem, there are enough other members of the same team to help him.

In addition, for the Web application, we decided to use Vue.js as our framework, it is a lightweight and simple framework for creating single-page Web applications. 


#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

In the beginning of the deliverable 3, we made the schedule plan too detail, so we find it would be hard to finish each steps on time considering that all the members still have other academic tasks and assignments from other lectures. 


#### Planned changes

We haven’t discussed with NomadHer team much about future desired features they want to be implemented, since the developing process is very close to an end. But we are planning to complete a chatroom feature, that allows users to chat/send text messages with each other. 



## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

1. Finished a robust and complete process, for user authentication: including uploading a photo ID and taking photos as required by random images guide, and admin’s manual verification process on another independent Web application.

2. As an addition on D2, we implemented the login associated with Email, now users can sign up/ login with their email and custom password, instead of Facebook.

3. Implemented the part where Master account users can manually compare and verify users' identities.


#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

1. Due to the limitation of the code structure, we find that the user has to finish the verification process in one time, or she would be able to finish the verification. 

2. We try to refactor that part of the code, but it would take more time then we have.


## Meeting Highlights

1. Spend more time on share the summary of personal work that finished by each team member.

2. Frequently exchange develop opinion with team members and apply the modification as necessary.
