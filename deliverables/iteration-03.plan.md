# Team 5 - NomadHer

## Iteration 03

 * Start date: March 25, 2019
 * End date: March 31, 2019

## Process

#### Changes from previous iteration


We stopped further development for the back-end server, according to the nomadher side request. In the iteration 3, we only maintain the exist features of the back-end server and connect the front-end directly to the database for the new features. We hope that it will reduce the develop complexity. The result can be easily evaluated since that we can have the team members that worked on back-end working on a new webpage for the administrators now.

#### Team Rules


##### Communications:
The expected communication frequency is at least once a week. Mainly through the WeChat tool, which can send text messages, files, pictures and conducts video meetings.
We have a partner project. We have a voice conference via Zoom (an online video chat app) or a text conference via Slack (an online chat app) with the NomadHer company every week for an hour. The specific date of a meeting is determined by mail communication of that week. Whenever we have problems, we will also ask us questions via Slack and look forward to responses. There will be 2 team members attending the meeting every week, which is determined by everyone's schedule. And they will record the important part of the meeting and share it with other members through WeChat.

##### Meetings:
At this stage, we divided our team into a four-person back-end team and a three-person front-end team. Each team arranged the time and place of the meeting according to the members' schedule (usually take voice calls through WeChat, or directly meet at Bahen centre). During the meeting, the team will assign tasks to each member, and after each complete their own work the team will gather together to view and discuss.

##### Conflict Resolution:
Scenario 1. The team wants to gather in a place and do some work, but can't find a valid time and place for all members.
Choose a time and place that is possible for the majority of team. When we meet, make the necessary records and send them to the members who are not present, so that they can keep up with the latest developments of our project. Members who are not present should also finish their work at home.
Scenario 2. A team member is non-responsive.
Contact this member via WeChat, messages and phone call, get to know his situation as soon as possible. If the member is unable to schedule time for teamwork due to other business, try to share some work and help him integrate into current work after he completes other tasks.
Scenario 3. Due to a member's wrong operation, the code on the git repository is missing or error.
Regular backup work to prevent the situation. All members should also be more careful about their work, such as working on a special branch and carefully checking their work before submitting the code


#### Events


On the March 25th, our team conducted a meeting on D3 in the tutorial classroom. At this meeting, we shared our opinions about the new features that we can add to our product during this iteration and made a record.
 
We plan to have the meeting of iteration 3 with nomadher on Tuesday, March 26th, using Slack. We will share our thoughts with them, and finally decide what features we will add during this iteration.
 
Then we plan to hold a team online voice conference through WeChat on the evening of March 26th. 
For this meeting, we are going to assign the exact roles and jobs to everyone based on the work decided at the morning meeting. Everyone should start their own work after this meeting.
 
Then, we plan to have all team members come together on March 30 and 31. We will sit together at one of the labs at Bahen centre. We will do some coding work to connect all the personally completed parts, and do some testing to make sure our product works well.


#### Artifacts


We use To-Do lists. When our group has a meeting, we will discuss the tasks we need to complete next, making To-Do lists, which will help us better assign tasks.
During the discussion, we will prioritize tasks by its functionality. We need to first complete the basic functions, such as simple login and verification via photos. After finishing the basics, we will move to next stage and then try to upgrade those features and optimize the looks.
We will let the team members choose the parts that they want to do. Usually, they will choose the parts that they are good at. Then we may adjust the tasks based on the workload. If some tasks require a lot of work, we may assign more people to that, and vice versa.
A schedule is important to our team. We will make up the schedule for each week’s work. In this way, we can manage the work more efficiently. And all team members should always do our best to finish their work according to the schedule, so we do not have to rush the work at the last moment.


#### Deployment and Github Workflow

##### Github Workflow
1. We created a new branch, nomadher-admin (used to implement  a separate Web application for the administrators to manually verify users).

2. Everyone work on the frontend checkout to nomadher-frontend. And everyone work on the administrator's web application (In D2 those members are responsible for the backend) checkout to nomadher-admin.

3. Before we start coding, we gave everyone a task. Each of us checkout a new branch from "nomadher-frontend" or "nomadher-admin" to finish our task.

4. In each commit, everyone should write clear comments, such as "frontend:..." or "admin:...". (Easy for debug in the future)

5. After each person finished and tested his task on his own task-branch, he would make a pull-request from his current task-branch to "nomadher-frontend" or "nomadher-admin". After the pull-request is approved by one of other team members, the task-branch will be merged and deleted.

6. After we tested code on branch "nomadher-frontend" or "nomadher-admin", we merged these two branches into master and did the final test.


##### Deployment process: 

In backend we are using flask app. We used Docker and Heroku to deploy our backend. Related steps include:

###### docker：
To start:
`docker build -t d3-301 .`

`docker run -d --name d3-301-container -p 80:80 d3-301:latest`

`docker start d3-301-container`

To stop/remove container:
`docker stop d3-301-container`

`docker rm d3-301-container`

###### heroku:
`heroku login`

`heroku create --app <app-server-name>`

`heroku container:login`

`heroku container:push web --app <app-server-name>`

`heroku container:release web --app <app-server-name>`

`heroku open --app <app-server-name>`

To deploy the front end, we used the tool exp by runnning `npm install -g exp`, and then run `exp build:android` to create an apk file, which can be used to install the app on the android phone.


## Product

#### Goals and tasks

For this iteration, we need to implement a separate Web application for the administrators to manually verify users, and add some new features to the mobile app prototype.

In order to accomplish this goal, we have the following tasks to do: 1. Implement a separate Web application for the administrators, which allows administrators to view the verification photos of all users and act on user verification status. 2. Write a email signup and login features for the application. 3. Improve the navigation flow for the application front-end and user interface beautification.


#### Artifacts

As the front-end team keeps developing on React-native mobile application, the admin Web application team used a brand new javascript framework Vue.js to create a lightweight Web application. This application can be accessed directly on web browser, after a successful login administrators can view each user’s uploaded photo ID and pose photos, verify or disqualify users, as well as deleting their uploaded pose photos. 

For UI design, we will draw the different frames of the mobile app on paper before we actually implement them, to make sure they are good-looking and capable of interacting with each other smoothly and reasonably.

And we will use UML to design the structure of the program, so the team members can understand different components exist in the program.
