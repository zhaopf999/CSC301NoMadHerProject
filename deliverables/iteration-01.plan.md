Project Name: NomadHer

## Process
#### Roles & responsibilities


We haven’t decided the tasks for each member in intricate details, because we are still at the early stage of development and not 100% sure about the specific challenges awaiting. Generally, we expect everyone to get involved in designing the structure, writing code on both frontend and backend, doing testing, etc. Everyone will be expected to do his/her work when the team needs him/her so that everyone will make the contribution.

#### Team Rules

Describe your team's working culture.

There is no typical fixed frequency of communication within the group as the amount workload and tasks varies at different times. We expect to communicate with other team members whenever there’s any issue surfaces & new task comes out & help needed, etc. 
We mainly use Wechat as our communication tool, on which we can send text messages, files, pictures and conduct video meetings. This makes our meeting time more flexible and able to leave records, thus reducing the impact of missing a meeting due to reasons such as having a course.
Our partner is the NomadHer team. We are using Slack(an online chat app) and Zoom (an online video chat app) to communicate with them. We have already finished an online video meeting through Zoom with the NomadHer team and the result is quite good. We are going to have one online video meeting with the NomadHer team per week this semester.

 
Meetings:


We alternately attend the meeting with the NomadHer team in different weeks, and each one of us is expected to join the meeting when it is his/her turn to do so. We keep a record of which team member attended which the previous meeting.  Before each meeting, we look at the record and discuss in advance in the Wechat group to decide who is going to represent our team to join the upcoming meeting with the NomadHer team. 

 
Conflict Resolution:
   Scenario 1: A team member is not responding other’s Wechat messages for more than 48 hours.
   Solution: Try to contact the member via phone call or SMS messages. If the member is still not responding, we would try to meet the member in the upcoming lecture. If the member does not show up on the lecture, we would ask TA for help.

   Scenario 2: One team member suddenly deletes the git repository and disappears. 
   Solution: Regularly backup the repository on local storage.

   Scenario 3:  A bug appears in the program, and two team members start to blame each other for causing the bug.
   Solution: Intervene in the argument. Members will be told to stop blaming each other, and work together to figure out a way to detect where the issue actually is, and find a solution.


#### Events
- We plan to meet with the representative from partner project once a week by voice online(zoom). During the meeting, we will report the work done last week and discuss the work to do this week.  We will also report any difficulties we met or any confusing points need to be clarified. 
- Meanwhile, our team members plan to meet each other after the tutorial every week. We will check and discuss the work that everyone has done last week, then distribute the work for this week. If anyone has any problem, we can try to figure out together.
- Every time we finish a complete part, we will do the code review with team through GitHub.




#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to organize your team.       

- We may use task boards. By making a task board, group members would have a clear idea of the part they should focus on.
- We will prioritize tasks by its functionality. We will do the basic part first, e.g. login, verification, and the database part. Then we will move to the upper part which uses these basic functionalities. 
- We will let the team members choose the parts that they want to do. Usually, they will choose the parts that they are good at. Then we may adjust the tasks based on the workload. If some tasks require a lot of work, we may assign more people to that, and vice versa.
- A schedule is important to our team. We will make up the schedule for each week’s work. In this way, we can manage the work more efficiently. And all team members should always do our best to finish their work according to the schedule, so we do not have to rush the work at the last moment.




## Product

#### Goals and tasks


For this iteration, we have several things to do. First, we need to gain some knowledge on React Native framework and Firebase database since it is a necessary technical skill that required by our partner. Second, we need to read the codes of our product since our product has already had a beta version. What we need to do is to implement more functionalities. And then, we are going to start implementing the login function. First, we will implement the logging in through Facebook and Gmail. 
And then we should be able to finish the first and second verifications which are asking the user to upload a photo ID and a video. We are going to keep it as manual checking for the staff of our partner company. Finally, we are going to try to use AI face verification which is hard to implement and not required by our partner. 


#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to present your project idea.

- We will use UML to design the structure of the program, so the team members can understand different components exist in the program.
- UI design: We will draw the different frames of the mobile app on paper before we actually implement them, to make sure they are good looking and capable of interacting with each other smoothly and reasonably.
