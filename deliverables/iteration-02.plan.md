#### Team Rules

##### Communications:

The expected communication frequency is at least once a week. Mainly through the WeChat tool, which can send text messages, files, pictures and conducts video meetings.

We have a partner project. We have a voice conference via Zoom (an online video chat app) or a text conference via Slack (an online chat app) with the NomadHer company every week for an hour. The specific date of a meeting is determined by mail communication of that week. Whenever we have problems, we will also ask us questions via Slack and look forward to responses. There will be 2 team members attending the meeting every week, which is determined by everyone's schedule. And they will record the important part of the meeting and share it with other members through WeChat.
 
##### Meetings:

At this stage, we divided our team into a four-person back-end team and a three-person front-end team. Each team arranged the time and place of the meeting according to the members' schedule (usually take voice calls through WeChat, or directly meet at Bahen centre). During the meeting, the team will assign tasks to each member, and after each complete their own work the team will gather together to view and discuss.
 
##### Conflict Resolution:

Scenario 1. The team wants to gather in a place and do some work, but can't find a valid time and place for all members.

Choose a time and place that is possible for the majority of team. When we meet, make the necessary records and send them to the members who are not present, so that they can keep up with the latest developments of our project. Members who are not present should also finish their work at home.

Scenario 2. A team member is non-responsive.

Contact this member via WeChat, messages and phone call, get to know his situation as soon as possible. If the member is unable to schedule time for teamwork due to other business, try to share some work and help him integrate into current work after he completes other tasks.

Scenario 3. Due to a member's wrong operation, the code on the git repository is missing or error.

Regular backup work to prevent the situation. All members should also be more careful about their work, such as working on a special branch and carefully checking their work before submitting the code.

#### Events

We had an initial meeting of iteration 2 with nomadher on Friday, March 1st. Then we are planning to have a team online voice conference through WeChat on Saturday, March 2nd. 

For this meeting, we are going to assign the exact roles and jobs to everyone. And then, during the tutorial time on Monday, March 4th, we are going to talk about the progress of each one’s responsibility and if there are any difficulty. 

If necessary, we are going to rearrange the jobs for some of us to make the work balance. And then, we are planning to have a couple of coding sessions on Thursday and Friday night. We will sit together at one of the labs at Bahen centre. For Saturday and Sunday, we are going to hold the code reviews and test our project entirely in person at one of the labs at Bahen centre. 

#### Artifacts

- We use To-Do lists. When our group has a meeting, we will discuss the tasks we need to complete next, making To-Do lists, which will help us better assign tasks.
- During the discussion, we will prioritize tasks by its functionality. We need to first complete the basic functions, such as simple login and verification via photos. After finishing the basics, we will move to next stage and then try to upgrade those features and optimize the looks.
- We will let the team members choose the parts that they want to do. Usually, they will choose the parts that they are good at. Then we may adjust the tasks based on the workload. If some tasks require a lot of work, we may assign more people to that, and vice versa.
- A schedule is important to our team. We will make up the schedule for each week’s work. In this way, we can manage the work more efficiently. And all team members should always do our best to finish their work according to the schedule, so we do not have to rush the work at the last moment.


#### Deployment and Github Workflow

Describe your Git / GitHub workflow. Essentially, we want to understand how your team members shares a codebase, avoid conflicts and deploys the application.

 * Be concise, yet precise. For example, "we use pull-requests" is not a precise statement since it leaves too many open questions - Pull-requests from where to where? Who reviews the pull-requests? Who is responsible for merging them? etc.
 * If applicable, specify any naming conventions or standards you decide to adopt.
 * Describe your overall deployment process from writing code to viewing a live applicatioon
 * What deployment tool(s) are you using and why
 * Don't forget to **explain why** you chose this workflow or particular aspects of it!

- Step1: We created two branches, nomadher-backend (used to implement backend part) and nomadher-frontend (used to implement frontend part)
- Step2: Everyone work on the backend checkout to nomadher-backend, and Everyone work on the frontend checkout to nomadher-frontend
- Step3: Before we start coding, we gave everyone a task. Each of us checkout a new branch from "nomadher-backend" or "nomadher-frontend" to finish our task.
- Step4: In each commit, we added "backend: " or "frontend: " at the beginning of commit comment. (Easy for debug in the future)
- Step5: After each person finished and tested his task on his own task-branch, he would make a pull-request from his current task-branch to "nomadher-backend" or "nomadher-frontend". After the pull-request is approved by one of other team members, the task-branch will be merged and deleted.
- Step6: After we tested code on branch "nomadher-backend" or "nomadher-frontend", we merged these two branches into master and did the final test.

- Deployment process: In backend we are using flask app. We used Docker and Heroku to deploy our backend. The process is same as A1. To deploy the front end, we used the tool exp by runnning "npm install -g exp", and then run "exp build:android" to create an apk file, which can be used to install the app on the android phone.

- Backend API on Heroku

## Product

#### Goals and tasks

For this iteration, we need to complete the user login - user authentication feature. In order to accomplish this goal, we have the following tasks to do: 1. Write the facebook login function 2. Write the photo verification function (the user needs to take a photo of the specified action and upload it for verification) 3. Write the photo ID upload function. 4. Continue to learn the knowledge about the React Native framework and Firebase database to help achieve the above functions. 5. If there is more time, try upgrading those features, such as using video to replace photos, etc.

#### Artifacts

- We will use UML to design the structure of the program, so the team members can understand different components exist in the program.
- UI design: We will draw the different frames of the mobile app on paper before we actually implement them, to make sure they are good-looking and capable of interacting with each other smoothly and reasonably.
